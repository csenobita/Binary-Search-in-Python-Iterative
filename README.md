Binary search algorithm in Python
Python Project â€“ A binary search algorithm finds an item in a sorted array in O(log(n)) time. The binary search algorithm can be implemented in Python using a simple while loop.

The array must first be sorted in ascending order to perform a binary search. Then, the algorithm will search the array for the target value by repeatedly dividing the search array in half until the target value is found. If the target value is not found in the array, the algorithm will return -1.

A binary search algorithm is a tool that can efficiently search large arrays. When implemented in Python, the binary search algorithm can quickly find an item in a sorted array.
